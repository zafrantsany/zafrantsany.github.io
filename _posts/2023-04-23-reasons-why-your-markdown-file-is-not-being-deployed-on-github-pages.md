There could be several reasons why your Markdown file is not being deployed on GitHub Pages. Here are a few common issues you can check:

1. Ensure that your repository is set up correctly: Your GitHub Pages site should be in the `username.github.io` repository (where "username" is your GitHub username). Make sure the repository is public.

2. Check your branch: Ensure that you've pushed your changes to the correct branch. By default, GitHub Pages uses the `main` or `master` branch for deployment. If you're using a custom branch, make sure to configure it in the repository settings.

3. Confirm Jekyll compatibility: If you're using Jekyll to build your site, ensure that your Markdown file is properly formatted and has the necessary front matter. The file should have a YAML front matter block at the top, like this:

```
---
layout: post
title: "My blog post"
date: 2023-04-23
---
```

4. File naming and location: Make sure your Markdown file has the `.md` or `.markdown` extension and is located in the correct directory. For a blog post, it should be in the `_posts` folder with a filename in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

5. Check the build status: If there's a problem with your site's build process, GitHub Pages won't deploy it. Check the build status on the repository settings page under the "GitHub Pages" section. If there's an error, you'll see a message with more information.

6. Time for propagation: After making changes and pushing them to your repository, it might take a few minutes for the changes to be reflected on your live site. Be patient and wait for the changes to propagate.

7. Clear cache: Sometimes, your browser's cache might be showing you an older version of your site. Try clearing your cache or opening the site in a different browser or incognito window.

If you've checked all these factors and are still having issues, consider looking at the GitHub Pages documentation or seeking help from the GitHub community.
